# Real-Time Chat System Using OpenSwoole

## Description
This project implements a real-time chat system using OpenSwoole and PHP, showcasing the capabilities of asynchronous programming and high-performance server architecture. The chat system allows multiple users to communicate in real-time, demonstrating efficient handling of concurrent connections.

## Features
- **Real-Time Communication:** Users can send and receive messages instantly without the need to refresh the page.
- **User Management:** Each user can join or leave the chat room dynamically, with notifications for other users.
- **Message Broadcasting:** Messages sent by one user are broadcasted to all connected users, ensuring a seamless chat experience.
- **Lightweight Architecture:** Built using OpenSwoole, the project leverages asynchronous I/O and coroutine capabilities to handle thousands of connections efficiently.

## Technologies Used
- **PHP:** The server-side programming language used to develop the chat application.
- **OpenSwoole:** A high-performance, coroutine-based PHP extension for building scalable applications.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** The front-end technologies used to create the user interface for the chat system.
- **Composer:** A dependency manager for PHP that simplifies the installation and management of libraries.
